The Fast Bill Application:

The Fast Bills application have started as a bill tracking project but idea
behind application is turning it to the bill paying application. User will be
able to track and pay any kind of bills. From regular monthly bills like gas,
internet, electricity to parking tickets, house tax. Main idea is paying all
regular bills with one click.

Developing proccess:

I started as a bill tracking project. User be able to add bills and tracks
how much bill pays in monthly and yearly base. Also be able to track usege of
electricity, gas, internet etc. So idea is  knowing what are you using and how much
are you paying? And then i realized bill needs to be paid. So I decided a add
paying option as a future feature. Far future idea is getting data of users
from the app and selling it to the other companies.
